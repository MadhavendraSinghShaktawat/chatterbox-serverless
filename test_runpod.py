    Picture this: It's 3 AM, and I'm scrolling through TikTok when I stumble upon the most mind-blowing conspiracy theory I've ever heard. 
    Apparently, dolphins are actually alien spies sent to monitor our beach activities. I know, I know, it sounds crazy, but hear me out.
    
    Think about it - dolphins are incredibly intelligent, they communicate in ways we don't fully understand, and they're always watching us from the water. 
    Plus, have you ever seen a dolphin blink? Exactly. That's because they don't have eyelids like Earth creatures should.
    
    But here's where it gets really wild. My friend Jake, who works at SeaWorld, told me that dolphins there have been acting strange lately. 
    They keep forming perfect geometric patterns in the water, almost like they're transmitting signals. And get this - every time a new iPhone is released, 
    the dolphins get more active. Coincidence? I think not.
    
    Now I can't go to the beach without feeling like I'm being watched. Every time I see a dolphin, I wave, just in case they're reporting back to their mothership. 
    Better safe than sorry, right?
